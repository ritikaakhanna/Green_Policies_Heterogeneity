  This paper tries to identify the heterogeneous impact of age and education levels on people’s voting behavior. This paper is an extension of a paper authored by Colantone, Lonardo, Margalit and Percoco in 2023 that attempts to identify the impact of gree policy imposition on the voting behaviors of the people of Milan, Italy. This paper tries to indetify the heterogeneity in the survey respondents' reception of the Area B ban discussed in the Colantone paper based on age and education levels. The findings suggest that more educated people are less likely to switch to the Coservative (opposition) party in light of a direct cost being imposed due to a green policy introduced by the Government, while a definitive relationship between age and propensity to switch to another political party was not found.

# Introduction

Every policy facilitates a redistribution of resources. Policymaking, in
this context, draws parallels to the first law of thermodynamics.Similar
to how energy cannot be created or destroyed in the universe,economic
policies do not conjure resources out of nowhere; instead, they focus on
the redistribution of these resources. This results in some stakeholders
reaping benefits, while others find themselves on the opposite side of
the spectrum, bearing the costs of others' advantages. Of late green
policies have become one such policy. While the nature of such a policy
is that all individuals would reap benefits from dodged climate change
ramifications, only a section of the society may be responsible for
bearing the costs associated with it. For example, the paper "The
Political Consequences of Green Policies" [@colantone2023] explores the
impact of Diesel Euro 4 car and other older versions (that do not adhere
to Europe's environmental standards and thus cause polluting effects)
ban from Area B. While this policy was intended to benefit all in the
vicinity of Milan by reduced emissions in the environment, only the ones
with the Diesel Euro 4 and older versions were adversely affected by the
ban. It was found that many people affected by the Area B ban switched
to a different political party (Lega) that criticized that particular
green policy indicating that such policies that impose a direct cost to
the voters may encourage them to shift their political leanings. Owners
of banned cars were on an average 13.5 percentage points more likely to
vote for the right wing opposition party in Italy called Lega. Thus,
their discontentment with the unfair costs imposed on them via the green
policy was translated into changed political choices.

This is important to understand because people's reception of green
policies determining their political leaning can deter the political
parties in power from introducing pro environmental policies which
obviously would not be ideal for our already deteriorating planet. In
this context, this paper has tried to identify the differences in the
responses of people in Milan to the Area B ban across different age
groups and education levels. The original study finds that in Milan,
people in the older and higher educated categories expressed a higher
propensity to switch to the opposition (Conservative) party as a result
of the Area B ban imposition. Thus, this paper has tried to identify the
relationship between these demographic variables and political leanings.

# Literature Review

The increasing public backlash against environmental policies
implemented by governments worldwide, exemplified by the rise of the BBB
political party in the Netherlands (originally conceived as a movement
against the nitrogen emissions ban on farmers imposed by the People's
Party for Democracy and Freedom), serves as a perfect example of how
citizens' dissatisfaction with a particular environmental policy can
reshape the political landscape of a country. This dissatisfaction does
not necessarily stem from their dislike for the environment, but the
economic costs imposed by the Government in the pursuit of preserving
the environment. Thus, the ubiquitous economic and environmental
tradeoff makes its way in the political arena as well. The
@colantone2023 findings suggest that the switch in respondents' voting
preferences was not a result of their environmental dislike but rather
the direct economic costs the owners of the cars affected by the Area B
ban that they had to bear as a result of the policy. Now, while the
economic status would largely determine and justify the respondents'
reaction to the policy, this paper majorly focuses on how age and levels
of education could possibly elicit different responses and reactions to
green policy imposed by the Government.

There have been various studies and a plethora of literature trying to
explore the causal relationship between age and individual's vote
preferences. For example, @geys2022 found that there was a non-linear
life cycle effects. Their main findings indicated that shifting towards
the left is more likely among the young (under 40 years) whereas
shifting towards the right occurs at an older age (over 55 years).
Several other studies such as @peterson2020 explicitly find a positive
linear relationship between age and conservative attitudes. While some
researchers suggest there are various biological and psychological
reasons as to why people become more conservative and traditional as
they age, and some studies such as @arndt2019 indicate shifts in
economic standing often coincide with the process of aging. Over the
course of one's career, financial resources typically increase and amass
momentum. As individuals progress into middle age, the rise in resources
may foster a heightened appreciation for a stable, predictable, and
secure society. Additionally, it may prompt a tendency to adopt
laissez-faire attitudes towards taxation and redistribution. Thus, there
is a myriad of research indicating that older people tend to be more
right leaning than younger people due to various reasons.

There seems to be a lack of consensus, however, in the literature
regarding the influence of education on an individual's voting
preferences. A study conducted in the UK by Marshall in 2012 in revealed
significant implications of a major education reform in the country. The
reform, which mandated students to stay in high school until the age of
15, was found to have a substantial impact on their voting choices later
in life. Marshall's findings indicated that each additional year of late
high school education increased the probability of voting for the
Conservative party in later life by 12 percentage points. @simon2022
found that obtaining higher education qualifications only had a small
direct on British individuals' adult attitudes, and that that effect was
not necessarily associated with liberal attitudes. Contrary to popular
assumptions about education's liberalizing role, this study demonstrates
that the education‐political values linkage is largely spurious.

Against this backdrop, this paper seeks to identify causal links between
education, age, and conservative/liberal attitudes, drawing on data from
the @colantone2023 study and the CSES Module 5 dataset.

# Data and Methodology

This paper has largely used the dataset provided by the authors of the
original study conducted in Italy wherein, the authors used the survey
data collected from YouGov from 1073 respondents regarding their
response to the Area B ban of Diesel Euro4 and older versions of cars.
The survey consisted questions on various aspects such as the car type
owned by the respondent. The survey also collected data on individuals
personal demographic characteristics such as age, income, education,
gender along with their voting behavior pre and post the green policy
(i.e., the Area B ban).

: Summary Statistics of Relevant Variables Used in the Dataset
{#tbl-main}

\*Note: The above table represents the summary statistics of the
relevant variables used in the Colantone et al study. The table
represents the proportion of the sample size of each demographic
category (age, gender, education and income) in the variables of
interest- control (Diesel Euro 4) and treatment (Diesel Euro 5, Petrol
Euro 4, and Petrol Euro 5)\*

Administered by YouGov in January 2021, the survey targeted owners of
various car types affected by the ban, with a specific focus on
Diesel-Euro4 car owners as the "treatment" group. They compared their
responses with three control groups, comprising owners of similar car
models unaffected by the ban (Diesel Euro 5, Petrol-Euro4, and
Petrol-Euro5). Additionally, they interviewed owners of new Euro6
category cars as a placebo test. The survey was meticulously designed to
address potential misreporting issues and control for individual
characteristics. The regression specification of models implemented in
the paper was specified as follows:

$$Y_{i} = \alpha + \beta_{1}Diesel_{i} + \beta_{2}Euro4_{i} + \gamma Diesel*Euro4_{i} + \theta X_{i} + \epsilon_{i},$$

where, outcome was the individual's decision to cast his/her vote for
the opposition party (Lega) that opposed the green policy- Area B ban.
The main explanatory variable is the interaction term diesel and euro 4
and delta the coefficient of interest. The Diesel and euro 4 dummy
variables were specified to net out the marginal effects of the diesel
euro 4 car owners (the treatment variable). Control variables such as
gender and fixed effects for education and income were also included in
the regressions. Therefore, primary analysis of the Colantone et al
paper centered on four car types---Diesel-Euro4, Petrol-Euro4,
Diesel-Euro5, and Petrol-Euro5---employing a difference-in-differences
approach to discern the effects of the Area B policy while considering
individual characteristics as fixed effects. As an extension of that
project, I have employed the same differences in differences method
while specifically checking for age and education levels as interactions
with the main explanatory variable (Diesel Euro4). For heterogeneous
treatment effects, the following specifications have been used in the
paper:

$$Y_{i} = \alpha + \beta_{1}Diesel Euro4_{i} + \beta_{2}Old_{i} + \gamma DieselEuro4_{i}*Old_{i} + \theta X_{i} + \epsilon_{i},$$$$Y_{i} = \alpha + \beta_{1}Diesel Euro4_{i} + \beta_{2}Education_{i} + \gamma DieselEuro4_{i}*Education_{i} + \theta X_{i} + \epsilon_{i},$$

In addition to the survey dataset, this paper has used Europe's
electoral database collected from Comparative Study of Electoral Systems
(CSES Module 5: 2016 \-- 2021). Through the CSES dataset, consisting 25
countries from Europe, this paper has tried to identify the general
demographic characteristics and their link with individual's voting
behaviors across Europe to assess whether the Milan phenomenon (of age
and education with political leanings) can be identified to other
countries in the Europe.

# Analysis and Discussion

![Error Bar plot of Multiple Regressions Conducted in the Study by
Colantone et
al.](/Users/ritikaakhanna/Desktop/PLSC%20Problem%20sets/psets/Final%20Project%20Code/combined_plot.png){#fig-example
width="110%"}

The error plot given in Figure 1 is a major finding of the Colantone et
al paper. The error plot graphically shows the coefficient estimates and
the standard error of the relevant variables in their specification
which contains the main treatment term diesel euro 4 (interaction
variable) and the control terms. The dummies for euro 4 and diesel have
been used in the specification to capture the marginal effects of these
variables on the dependent variable. The dependent variable used in this
graph is a dummy indicating whether the individual respondents switched
to Lega (the opposition party that particularly voiced its
discontentment with the Area B ban) from their previous voting choice
(the present Government or any other political party).

The idea here is to capture the impact of owning the diesel and euro 4
cars to be able to net out the impact of owning our treatment variable
of interest, that is, diesel euro 4 cars. To interpret the results of
the error plot substantively, panel a) consists of switching to Lega in
a legislative election as the dependent variable, while panels b) and c)
have switching to Lega in a Regional and Municipal elections
respectively. The plots titled 1 are regressions with no controls, 2 are
with controls such as gender and income and education as fixed effects.
The plots titled 3 have included the 65 respondents who were not aware
of their car type (Diesel or Euro 4) but had self-reported to be
affected by the ban.

To interpret the regression estimates in the error plots systematically,
we'll first start with the Legislative elections. The coefficient
estimate for the regression without controls was 0.116, implying that
owing a Diesel Euro 4 car made the respondents 11.6 percentage points
more likely to switch to Lega in the 2019 elections from the previous
2018 Legislative elections. The coefficient estimate was higher with
controls at 0.151, implying a 15.1 percentage point increase in the
likelihood of switching to Lega in the elections. Similarly, when
accounted for the 65 respondents who were not aware of their car type
but with all the controls and fixed effects in the regression
specification, the authors found a statistically significant effect of
15.3 percentage point increase in the likelihood of switching to the
Lega party. Similar results were found for the municipal and regional
elections as well, wherein individuals with Diesel Euro 4 had higher
positive chances of switching to Lega. With controls and fixed effects
as seen in the error plots 2) and 3) of panels a, b and c had
statistically significant estimates with a more precise estimate and
smaller standard error.

In order to understand the heterogeneity impact on the decision to
switch to the Lega party, I conducted a similar Difference in Difference
methodological approach used by the authors and added the dummy for
"old" with the main explanatory variable diesel euro 4 to understand if
there were any differences between older and younger people's acceptance
of the policy, thus their voting choice in the Elections held in Italy
in 2019 as seen in Table2.

: Age Heterogeneity Regression Results {#tbl-main}

As indicated in Table 2, the interaction term 'old\*diesel euro4' in the
regression suggests that the marginal effect of being classified as old
(defined here as a dummy variable equal to 1 for individuals aged 45 and
above) and owning a diesel euro 4 car resulted in a notable increase in
the likelihood of switching to the Lega party. Specifically, the
increase was 37.1 percentage points in Legislative, 38.1 percentage
points in Regional, and 39.7 percentage points in Municipal elections.
In contrast, younger voters exhibited a slightly lower propensity to
switch to the Lega party. For voters under the age of 45, the likelihood
of switching to Lega was lower compared to the older population by 6.1
percentage points in Legislative elections, 8.6 percentage points in
Regional elections, and 5.4 percentage points in Municipal elections.
These findings suggest that, with age, individuals may lean more towards
conservatism. This aligns with findings from several studies, including
@arndt2019 and @peterson2020 , which propose that conservatism tends to
increase with age, driven by financial factors such as heightened
economic incentives and reduced tax burdens. Consequently, the economic
impact of the green policy on older individuals manifests more swiftly
in changes to political preferences compared to their younger
counterparts.

Given the absence of a universally agreed-upon definition of 'old age'
in the academic literature, this paper also explored the analysis with
different age cutoffs.

![Error Bar plot Age Regressions with Different
Cutoffs](/Users/ritikaakhanna/Desktop/PLSC%20Problem%20sets/psets/Final%20Project%20Code/age_errorplot.png)

The error bar plot in Figure 2 represents the differences in coefficient
estimates of the interaction term old\*Diesel_Euro4 when we change the
cut-off of the old age dummy variable from age 30 to 35 and so on.  This
implies how the coefficients change for the interaction term as we
change the definition of old in the dataset. In tandem with the initial
hypothesis, as the cutoff age increases, the likelihood to switch to the
Conservative party (Lega) had increased for the respondents surveyed in
Milan. As can be seen from the plot above, on defining 35 as the cutoff
age, for the sample aged 35 years or more, the coefficient estimate
turned out to be 0.06 percentage points, for cutoff age 40 and 45, the
coefficient was even higher implying that as the average population gets
older the propensity to switch from a liberal to Conservative party
increases. However, for cutoff at age 30 and cutoff at age 55 we get
negative point estimates with a large standard error. This anomaly could
be arising out of the fact that we have very low number of observations
on the either ends of the dataset, thus the high standard error.

: Education Heterogeneity Regression Results {#tbl-main}

Table 3 presents the outcomes of the education heterogeneity regression,
wherein the high education variable serves as a dummy variable
identifying individuals with advanced degrees (Masters or Bachelors,
represented by the EDU2 and EDU3 variables in the @colantone2023
dataset). Conversely, those with education up to high school or less are
assigned a value of "0" in this dummy variable. In contrast to other
regressions in the paper, this model exclusively incorporates income as
fixed effects to mitigate multicollinearity.

The interaction term high education \* diesel euro 4 reveals that
individuals with high education possessing diesel euro 4 cars (impacted
by the ban) were 5.7 percentage points more likely to shift allegiance
to Lega in Legislative elections. This trend is echoed with 6.8 and 0.1
percentage points in the regional and municipal elections, respectively.
While in Legislative elections, less educated car owners exhibited a
slight decrease (-0.001) in the likelihood of switching to Lega compared
to their highly educated counterparts, the opposite pattern emerges in
municipal and regional elections. Notably, in these elections, highly
educated individuals were significantly less prone to switch to Lega
compared to their less educated counterparts, indicating a substantial
disparity in estimates. After conducting the analysis, a consistent
trend emerged, indicating that individuals affected by the Area B ban
were inclined to switch to Lega across all demographic categories in the
three elections under consideration. Nonetheless, a nuanced distinction
appeared regarding the likelihood of these groups switching to the
Conservative party. Notably, older individuals exhibited a heightened
propensity to switch to the opposition party. In contrast, individuals
with lower levels of education demonstrated a slightly elevated
inclination to switch compared to their more educated counterparts in
the municipal and regional elections. These findings are in alignment
with @wang2022's findings that educational attainment is associated with
higher levels of pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors and thus
greater political inclination towards left leaning political parties.

: Regressing Political Preference on Demographic Characteristics in
Europe {#tbl-main}

The presence of large standard errors in these estimates underscores the
limited availability of data, introducing a degree of uncertainty. To
assess the robustness of the observed dynamics, particularly in the case
of Milan, this paper endeavors to identify heterogeneity causal effects
across Europe. Utilizing data from the Comparative Study of Electoral
Systems, as outlined in Table 4, the regression model focuses on the
likelihood of individuals switching their votes from left-wing to
right-wing political parties.

The dataset comprises observations from 25 European countries, primarily
covering elections held between 2016 and 2021. The key explanatory
variables are age and education, with additional control variables such
as political ideology, values, and family income. The coefficient of
political ideology, reflecting the strength of an individual's political
perceptions, is significantly negative, indicating that those with
strong political values are less prone to changing their political
preferences. The variable "values" controls for other personal and
social values.

Interestingly, the education variable, measured by ranks assigned to
different levels of education, shows a negative impact. This suggests
that individuals with higher education may be less likely to switch to a
right-wing political party, aligning with our findings from Italy.
However, the relationship with age reveals a distinct pattern---older
individuals are less likely to switch to the Conservative Party. This
warrants further investigation and analysis, as the results may differ
due to potential non-representativeness of Milan in Italy compared to
the broader European context.

# Conclusion

In summary, this study delves into the intricate interplay between
environmental policies, individual responses, and their consequent
impact on political preferences. The examination of Milan's Area B ban
on Diesel Euro 4 cars serves as a focal point for scrutinizing how
policy-induced economic costs can shape political choices. The results
illuminate a notable shift in voting preferences, particularly towards
the right-wing opposition party Lega, among owners of the prohibited
vehicles. The discontent stemming from perceived unfair costs imposed by
the green policy manifests in a substantial realignment of political
affiliations. Moreover, the study delves into how age and education
shape responses to environmental policies. It suggests that in Milan,
older and more educated individuals were likelier to switch to the
opposition party in response to the Area B ban. This aligns with broader
research that establishes a connection between age, education, and
political leanings.

When examining the European context, the study takes a comparative
approach to validate its findings. The analysis reveals nuanced
patterns, indicating that older individuals across Europe are less
likely to shift towards conservative parties, while higher education has
a negative impact on such political shifts. However, the study
acknowledges data limitations and emphasizes the need for further
exploration to confirm if Milan's dynamics are applicable on a broader
European scale.

The study's implications extend beyond Milan, indicating challenges for
policymakers working on pro-environmental policies. It highlights the
delicate balance between environmental goals and economic
considerations, stressing that perceived economic costs can sway
political affiliations and influence policy acceptance. Recognizing
these dynamics is crucial for policymakers to navigate public sentiment
effectively and ensure the successful implementation of environmentally
friendly initiatives without adverse political consequences.
